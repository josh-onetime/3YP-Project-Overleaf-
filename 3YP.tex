	\subsection[Product Description]{Product Description - Jim Laney}
	
		The pipe inspection robot works in underground pipes in urban areas, with a pipe diameter from $457.2$ mm to $914.4$ mm and with pipes at any angle, providing a map of the pipe with the location of any failures to the operator. % 18 - 36 inches; Needs citation for pipe sizes?
		The robot reduces the disruption caused by having to dig up large areas of pipe for inspection, since the issue can be located and smaller, less disruptive work can be undertaken.
		It is intended to provide an inspection method for pipes which cannot be inspected by the current leading method, Pipe Inspection Gauges (PIGs), which only work in horizontal or near horizontal straight pipes\textsuperscript{\cite{mills2017advances}}.
		It enters a pipe using a launch tube, and travels autonomously along the inside of the pipe, checking for evidence of cracks and corrosion and logging their location for future maintenance.
		\\
		
		\begin{figure}[h] % Would like to do this as a text wrapped figure but that can be finnicky so would like to agree on this as a group before attempting it

			\label{3DSketch}
		\end{figure}
		
		While inside the pipe, the robot uses three legs to maintain contact and provide the required normal force to move inside the pipe, as shown in \hyperref[3DSketch]{Figure \ref*{3DSketch}}.
		Two of these legs can be rotated to provide improved speeds over pipes at different angles, and all three legs can be extended and retracted to fit the pipe diameter the robot is currently in.
		It can navigate around bends and through pipes at different angles, without prior knowledge of the location or angle of these, and will automatically feedback to the control system in order to create an accurate map.
		\\
		The robot uses computer vision to identify cracks and corrosion, allowing it to mark where these occur for human maintenance, and then combines this with knowledge of its position to create a map of the pipe it has travelled and where issues have occurred.
		It can transmit its location using a small transmitter, which has a separate power supply so that if the robot breaks down it can be located with minimal excavation.
	
	\subsection[Patent Analysis]{Patent Analysis - Jim Laney}

		It was decided to look at patents classified as \verb|F16L55/26| - "Pigs or moles, i.e. devices movable in a pipe or conduit with or without self-contained propulsion means" or \verb|F16L2101/30| - "Inspecting, measuring or testing [as a use or application of pigs or moles]" as these are most similar to the purpose which the robot fulfils.
		In these patents the use of "pigs" refers to Pipeline Inspection Gauges (PIGs from here on), and moles are used as a synonymous term, and will thus also be referred to as PIGs from now on.
		While the robot is not a PIG as PIGs are typically unpowered and cannot deal with bends in the pipe, this is the closest patent classification to consider.
		\begin{figure}[h]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[height=\imageheight]{patentGraph}
				\caption{Cumulative number of published patents in the European Patent Office database classified as \texttt{F16L55/26}\textsuperscript{\cite{patent26}} or \texttt{F16L2101/30}\textsuperscript{\cite{patent30}} }
				\label{patentGraph}
		\end{figure}
		\\
		As you can see from \hyperref[patentGraph]{Figure \ref*{patentGraph}}, the rate of patent publication in both classifications is still growing at a rapid rate, suggesting the technology is in a period of rapid innovation and development.
		This suggests that industry is still in the initial period of product design ferment, where no dominant design has occurred\textsuperscript{\cite{christensen1998innovation}}.
		Thus there is a much greater chance of survival, as this dominant design has not yet been established, and the space for new innovators is greater.
		While there is also a risk to entering the industry too early, the sustained period of development in the last 20 years suggests that period has passed.

		\subsection[Locomotion]{Locomotion - Jim Laney}
			
			%By Jim
			The main locomotion of the robot is a set of 3 legs with a pantograph mechanism  to allow for the adaptation to different diameters, with tracks at the end to drive the motion, as shown in \hyperref[legDesign]{Figure \ref*{legDesign}}.
			There is one leg which remains stationary at the top of the robot, and two legs which are able to rotate about the body of the robot between $20^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ to the vertical.
			At the end of each leg there is a passive joint between the leg and the track to allow for the robot to travel along surfaces which are not perpendicular to the legs, such as around bends or over uneven surfaces.
			\\
			The length of the pantograph is controlled by the force from two opposing linear actuators, which extend to a given length to set the distance of the pantograph.
			The track at the end of the pantograph is connected to a freely turning joint, which can be measured using two angular encoders to give the angle $\phi$, shown in \hyperref[legDiagram]{Figure \ref*{legDiagram}}, with the springs acting to restore $\phi$ to $0^\circ$ when under no external effects.
			In addition to this, the tracks use an active compliance joint, as shown in \hyperref[activeCompliance]{Figures \ref*{activeCompliance} \& \ref*{unevenBehaviour}}, which allows for the robot to maintain maximum surface contact at all times.
			\\
			The active compliance joint consists of a torsional spring and radio-controlled servo motor, which are both attached around the same axis.
			However, the servo motor is attached to the rear tracks, whereas the spring is attached between the front track and the servo motor itself.
			When the robot passes over an uneven surface, the servo motor forces the front track down, maintaining contact with the pipe wall, as shown in \hyperref[unevenBehaviour]{Figure \ref*{unevenBehaviour}(a)}
			If instead the robot is in a section where the pipe wall is concave, the torsional spring will allow it to fold, shown in \hyperref[unevenBehaviour]{Figure \ref*{unevenBehaviour}(b)}, and maintaining contact with as much of the wall as possible.
			The active compliance joint also includes an angular encoder to tell how much the front track has been bent, allowing for the active compliance joint to be better controlled.

			\\
			The rotation of the two base legs relative to the body of the robot occurs using a motor to drive each end of the rotation mechanism.
			The motor drives the sun gears of two planetary gear systems, shown in \hyperref[planetaryDrive]{Figure \ref*{planetaryDrive}},which rotate in opposite direction so the legs move symmetrically.
			The direction is reversed for the further planetary drive system using a small differential gearbox, shown in \hyperref[diffGearbox]{Figure \ref*{diffGearbox}}, which allows for compact reversal of motion.
			These allow the legs to move around the body, from almost directly below the robot to in a horizontal plane at $90^\circ$ to the top leg.
			As both legs are driven from the same motor at each end, both legs are symmetrical about the vertical leg at all times, and the leg position can be summarised by a single leg rotation angle $\lambda$, measured from the top leg, which varies from $\lambda = 90^\circ$ to $\lambda = 160^\circ$.
			The rotation allows the robot to adapt to different angles of the pipe more easily, as it will be quicker to drive along horizontal pipes with the almost vertical drive system, whereas vertical pipes require a more even distribution of contact points for optimal behaviour, probably requiring an angle of $\lambda = 120^\circ$ for the most even distribution of contact points.

			The ratio between the longer base links of the pantograph and then shorter tip links is $2:1$, which gives the greatest range of diameters for the smallest change in the base distance\textsuperscript{\cite{okada1987mogrer}}, to calculate the required link length $L$ to allow the robot to adapt to the chosen range of diameters, $457.2 - 914.4$ mm.
			The pantograph angles are shown in \hyperref[legDiagram]{Figure \ref*{legDiagram}}, which results in:
			
			\begin{align}
				r_{min} &= \frac{3L}{2} \sin \left( \theta_{min} \right)
				\\
				r_{max} &= \frac{3L}{2} \sin \left( \theta_{max} \right)
				\\
				\implies \Delta r &= \frac{3L}{2} \left( \sin \left( \theta_{max} \right) - \sin \left( \theta_{min} \right) \right)
				\\
				L &= \frac{2 \Delta r}{3 \left( \sin \left( \theta_{max} \right) - \sin \left( \theta_{min} \right) \right)}
			\end{align}
			
			Assuming the pantograph will ideally move from an angle of $\theta_{min} = 10^\circ$ to $\theta_{max} = 60^\circ$, spanning a change in radius of $228.6$ mm, $L = 220.1$ mm, and the smallest leg radius $r_{min} = 57.3$ mm, not including the depth of the tracks.
			This means that, if the track depth is $70$ mm, the body diameter $D_r$ has a maximum of $202.5$ mm, setting a constraint on the dimensions of the inner body based on the design criteria.
			\\
			The minimum length of the body is also set by this, as it means that the body length $l_{min} = L \cos \left( \theta_{min} \right) = 216.8$ mm.
			A maximum body length can be found by considering the ability of the robot to turn corners inside the pipe, and it is necessary to consider how this compares to the minimum to make sure there is no loss of mobility.
			For the duration of this calculation, it is assumed that the robot is in the smallest possible pipe diameter $D_{pipe} = 457.2$ mm, and the curvature radius $r_c = \frac{3}{2} D_{pipe} = 685.8$ mm.
			As the robot diameter $D_r \nless \left( 2 \sin \left( 45^\circ \right) - 1 \right) D_{pipe}$ mm the maximum length can be found from the following equation\textsuperscript{\cite{roh2005differential}}:

			\begin{align}
				l_{max} &= 2 \sqrt{4D_{pipe}^2 - \left( D_{pipe} + D_r\right) ^ 2}
				\intertext{which, using the maximum $D_r = 436.4$ mm}
				l_{max} &= 1266.3 \ \mathrm{mm} \notag
			\end{align}
			% Makes max volume 187*10^6 mm^3
			Using \hyperref[legDiagram]{Figure \ref*{legDiagram}} to calculate the required force output of the linear actuators in order for the robot to operate at all angles.
			As such, the worse case scenario is considered, where the robot is climbing vertically and must create enough normal force for friction to support its entire weight.
			This results in:
			
			\begin{align}
				N &= \frac{2 F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)}
				\\
				F_f &= \mu_{t,p} N
				\\
				&= \frac{2 \mu_{t,p} F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)}
				\intertext{where $F_f$ is the frictional force on one track, and $\mu_{t,p}$ is the coefficient of friction between the tracks and the pipe. \newline In order for this to balance the weight W:}
				\begin{split}
					W &= 3 F_f
					\\
					&= \frac{6 \mu_{t,p} F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)} \label{maxWeight}
				\end{split}
				\\
				\implies F &= \frac{W \cos \left( \phi \right)}{6 \mu_{t,p} \tan \left( \theta \right)} \label{reqMaxNorm}
			\end{align}
			
			Since testing would be required to find the greatest angle $\phi$ that is experienced by the robot in general use, as well as an estimate for the coefficient of friction $\mu_{t,p}$, it is tricky to estimate the force required for the actuators.
			However, estimates from other papers for $\mu_{t,p}$,which are $1.21$\textsuperscript{\cite{sato2011development}} - $1.6$\textsuperscript{\cite{park2010normal}}, allow us to create a worst case estimate for the required force of $1.21$.
			From \hyperref[reqMaxNorm]{Equation \ref*{reqMaxNorm}}, it is clear that the worst case scenario occurs in straight sections, where $\phi$ is expected to be close to $0^\circ$, with the smallest pipe diameter, as this minimises $\theta$, which will require the most linear actuator force.

		\subsection[Communications]{Communications - Louis Emmanuel}
		%by Louis

		Communication is an important capability for the autonomous robot as in order to operate it safely and efficiently, it's critical to know the whereabouts of the robot within the pipe at any given time. 
		An additional and more complex requirement is also the ability for bidirectional communication so the robot can be updated on its position and given instructions when necessary. 
		\\
	    The difficulty arises in finding a suitable communication method that is capable of operating in the difficult pipeline environment. 
	    With pipe bends, thick steel walls, metres of soil, and noise interference, the choice of communication must be able to overcome these barriers without inhibiting locomotion. 
	    \hyperref[commsTable]{Figure \ref*{commsTable}} outlines several communication methods which have been widely practiced in the Oil and Gas industry\textsuperscript{\cite{acoustic2020}}.
	    \\
	    
        \begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{commstable.pdf}
			\caption{Communications Comparison}
			\label{commsTable}
		\end{figure}
     	A critical requirement of the robot is for it to have a real time understanding of its location in order to navigate pipes and localise pipe damage. 
     	From the solutions in \hyperref[commsTable]{Figure \ref*{commsTable}}, the only methods capable of this are ELF and wiring. 
     	However, ELF communications requires a significantly sized receiver [x] which is infeasible to house in the robot without inhibiting speed, locomotion and range. 
     	Consequently, for feeding data to the robot, a wire will be used.
        \\ 
        \hspace*{3ex}Although a wire allows bidirectional communication, it is incapable of determining the position of the robot. 
        Therefore, a method of communicating with surface receivers must be used in order to determine its position. 
        Given the size constraints and interference challenges, acoustic and magnetic methods are unsuitable for this application. 
        Instead, ELF communication is used which with present technology [x] is capable of travelling through up to 20m of soil. 
        This allows location to be determined, and fed back to the robot through the wiring in order to compensate for the the accumulated locating error generated in the on board INS.
         
        $\textbf{Communication Map}$
        
        \begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=1]{comms layout.pdf}
			\caption{Communications layout}
			\label{commsLayout}
		\end{figure}
        
        \hyperref[commsLayout]{Figure \ref*{commsLayout}} provides an overview of the communication architecture. 
        Starting from the operator, an optical fibre which is capable of bidirectional communication is fed down to the robot by an automatic cable reel. 
        On board the robot is an ELF transmitter which pulses ELF waves at 22Hz to to the receivers above ground. 
        These receivers then calculate the global position of the robot, and feed it back down to the robot via the optical fibre.
       
        \textbf{Wired connection}
        \\
        The wired communication line presents a challenge for the locomotion of the robot. 
        In order to satisfy the communication requirements, it must deliver data at a suitable rate without creating a hindrance to locomotion along the pipe and around corners. 
        The proposed solution uses a Kevlar lined wire with an optical fibre. 
        Through making assumptions on a constant frictional coefficient throughout the pipe and steady speed, we arrive at the following initial equation for drag. 
        \begin{align}
				F_0 = \mu_g L_{wire}   g \rho
		\end{align}
        
        % Not sure about this value of F0
        
        Where $L_{wire}$ is the length of wire at current time, $\mu_g$ is the coefficient of friction between the cable and ground and $\rho$ is the mass per unit length of the cable.
        
        This equation is very simple and does not take into account the corners the robot is designed to navigate. 
        Therefore, through modelling corners as segments of a cylinder, we can justify the use of the capstan equation [x] which describes the resistance to sliding of a flexible but inextensible cord wrapped around a cylinder. 
        For a series of corners, the following equation is derived.
        \begin{align}
                F_D = F_0 \boldsymbol{\cdot} {e}^{\mu_c \sum \alpha} \label{cableDrag}
        \end{align}

		Where $\mu_c$ is the coefficient of friction between the cable and corners and $\alpha$ is the angle swept by the cable around the cylinder in radians. 
	    Hence, in order to minimise this drag force, a solution must be found that satisfies the bandwidth capabilities whilst minimising the mass per length and friction coefficients.  
	    In this case, a Fiber optic cable is better in almost every sense over alternatives. 
	    For example, a typical fiber cable weighs 4Lbs/1000ft, requires a power of 2W and is immune to noise. 
	    In comparison, the next best alternative is copper wire which weighs 36Lbs/1000ft, requires >10W of power and is susceptible to EM interference [x].
	    \\
	    Finally, in order to minimise friction coefficients and absorb the large tensile strength in the wire, a protective coating must be applied to the cable. 
	    This technology is widely developed with smoothed Kevlar reinforced cable offering a low friction coefficient whilst resisting tensile strengths up to 2800MPa [x]. For the case of a 5mm Kevlar reinforced optical fibre cable, a breaking force of 54kN can be achieved. 
	    Considering an upper estimate of \hyperref[cableDrag]{Equation \ref*{cableDrag}} using $\mu$ = 0.2 [x] L = 500m $\rho$ = 0.04 $Kgm^-1$ [x] $\sum \alpha = 10\pi/2$, a tensile force of $F_D$ = 907N is estimated which is well below maximum. 
	    
	    \textbf{Automatic Cable Reel}

        From \hyperref[cableDrag]{Equation \ref*{cableDrag}}, it is demonstrated that the drag force on the robot is directly proportional to the length of wire. 
        Therefore, a requirement for the reel is for it to supply the minimum amount of wire without introducing significant tension. 
        Further, the reel must be capable of self winding when the robot makes its return journey, otherwise it will impede it.
        \\ 
        \hspace*{3ex}Fortunately there are established solutions which provide this capability. 
        The automatic cable reels offered by Minicam and IPEK both offer motorised winding which is specialised for robot pipe inspection. 
        \hyperref[comparisonReels]{Figure \ref*{comparisonReels}} compares the weight, size, power consumption and cost of each solution. 
        The MiniCam ACR 500 is chosen as it is lighter and smaller.

        \textbf{ELF transmitter}
        
        In the system, the robot is located using the magnetic field generated by the ELF electromagnetic emitter. 
        The emitter consists of a signal generator, Ni–Zn magnetic core, power amplifier and an emitting winding in order to create the resonant frequency. 
        Also, the emitting coil is divided into two equal parts in parallel connection. 
        This method is helpful for improving the emitting power and reducing the power consumption. 
        \\
        \hspace*{3ex}The structure of the emitter is shown below. 
        As a precautionary measure, on board batteries are also included in the transmitter to ensure that in the case of a wire and robot breakdown, the robot can still be recovered.

		\subsection[Inclination Detection]{Inclination Detection - Jim Laney}
		
		The robot is able to detect the inclination of the pipe it is in for calculation of the required leg force, as well as to aid in the mapping of the pipe.
		While the AHRS can give the angle of the robot relative to the wider world, it is not guaranteed that the robot body is parallel to the pipe.
		As such, the angle between the pipe and the robot needs to be accounted for in order to correctly measure the pipe angle.
		\\
		\begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[height=\imageheight]{pipeOrientation}
			\caption{Angles used for calculation of pipe angle. Figure from \cite{park2010normal}}
			\label{pipeOrientation}

			\centering
			\includegraphics[height=\imageheight]{pipeAngle}
			\caption{Position of the robot within the pipe. (i) Within a horizontal or vertical bend, (ii) Within a bend at angle $\xi$ to the vertical, view shown relative to the bend rather than relative to the outside world}
			\label{pipeAngle}
		\end{figure}
		As in \hyperref[pipeOrientation]{Figure \ref*{pipeOrientation}}, the angle of the robot within the pipe can be decomposed into two orthogonal rotations, of $\alpha$ about the pipe diameter, and then $\beta$ about the robot centre, shown as $z'$ in the figure.
		Since the angle of the top leg, $\phi_T$, is $\alpha$ on the $y'$ axis ($\beta = 0$), but zero on the x axis ($\beta = 90^\circ$), the angle can be estimated using:
		\begin{align}
			\phi_T &= \cos \left( \beta \right) \alpha
			\\
			\phi_L &= \cos \left( \beta + \lambda \right) \alpha
			\intertext{where $\lambda$ is the leg rotation angle as shown in \hyperref[pipeAngle]{Figure \ref*{pipeAngle}}:}
			\frac{\phi_L}{\phi_T} &= \frac{\cos \left( \beta + \lambda \right)}{\cos \left( \beta \right)}
			\\
			\beta &= \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{ \sin \left( \lambda \right)} \left( \frac{\phi_L}{\phi_T} + \cos \left( \lambda \right) \right) \right)
			\\
			\alpha &= \frac{\phi_T}{\cos \left( \beta \right)}
		\end{align}
		Once the individual rotations of the robot are found, they can combine this with the AHRS data to find the pipe angle relative to the outside world.
		\\
		Working in 3D space, the AHRS returns rotations in a matrix $\mathbf{R}_{R,W}$, which gives the angle of the robot relative to the world.
		In order to find $\mathbf{R}_{P,W}$, the rotation of the pipe relative to the world, a matrix $\mathbf{R}_{P,R}$ is created, which gives the rotations of the pipe, relative to the robot:
		\begin{align}
			\mathbf{R}_{P,R} &=
			\begin{bmatrix}
				\cos \left( \alpha \right) & 0 & - \sin \left( \alpha \right)
				\\
				- \sin \left( \alpha \right) \sin \left( \beta \right) & \cos \left( \beta \right) & - \cos \left( \alpha \right) \sin \left( \beta \right)
				\\
				\sin \left( \alpha \right) \cos \left( \beta \right) & \sin \left( \beta \right) & \cos \left( \alpha \right) \cos \left( \beta \right)
			\end{bmatrix}
			% Matrices can be shrunk using smallmatrix rather than bmatrix but for now no need to - smallmatrix requires you to pu \left[ and \right] on either side of the smallmatrix environment
			\\
			\mathbf{R}_{P,W} &= \mathbf{R}_{P,R} \ \mathbf{R}_{R,W}
			\intertext{The general form of a rotation matrix can then be used to determine the yaw, roll and pitch from $\mathbf{R}_{P,W}$:}
			\mathbf{R}_{P,W} &= \left[
			\begin{smallmatrix}
				\cos(\psi_x) \cos(\psi_y) & \quad & \sin(\psi_x) \cos(\psi_y) \sin(\psi_z) - \sin(\psi_y) \cos(\psi_z) & \quad & \sin(\psi_x) \cos(\psi_y) \cos(\psi_z) + \sin(\psi_y) \sin(\psi_z)
				\\ \\
				\cos(\psi_x) \sin(\psi_y) & \quad & \sin(\psi_x) \sin(\psi_y) \sin(\psi_z) + \cos(\psi_y) \cos(\psi_z) & \quad & \sin(\psi_x) \sin(\psi_y) \cos(\psi_z) - \cos(\psi_y) \sin(\psi_z)
				\\ \\
				- \sin(\psi_x) & \quad & \cos(\psi_x) \sin(\psi_z) & \quad & \cos(\psi_x) \cos(\psi_z)
			\end{smallmatrix} 
			\right] \notag
			\\
			\psi_x &= \sin^{-1} \left( \ \mathbf{R}_{P,W} \left[ 3, 1\right] \ \right) \label{pipeX}
			\\
			\psi_y &= \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\ \mathbf{R}_{P,W} \left[ 2, 1\right] \ }{\mathbf{R}_{P,W} \left[ 1, 1\right]} \right) \label{pipeY}
			\\
			\psi_z &= \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{ \ \mathbf{R}_{P,W} \left[ 3,2 \right] \ }{\mathbf{R}_{P,W} \left[ 3,3 \right] } \right) \label{pipeZ}
		\end{align}
		Thus, in order to increase the efficiency of the algorithm, only the relevant entries of $\mathbf{R}_{P,W}$ need to be calculated, meaning that the number of computations required can be reduced to $\frac{5}{9}$ of the original value.
		These angles can also be used to help with the identification of other things within the robot, but the reliability of these is not guaranteed, as the angle of the legs can be affected by other factors, such as unevenness in the pipe wall.
		As such, the value for the inclination of the pipe should be averaged out to give better results for pipe inclination, and giving a smoother projection of the map overall.
		
		\subsection[Leg Actuation Control]{Leg Actuation Control - Jim Laney}
		
		The robot needs to be able to accurately control the length of its legs in order to maintain the correct normal force for operation.
		The required linear actuator force for climbing vertically is given \hyperref[reqMaxNorm]{Equation \ref*{reqMaxNorm}}, which can be modified to find that:
	
		\begin{align}
			F &= \frac{W \sin \left( \psi_x \right) \cos \left( \phi \right)}{6 \mu_{t,p} \tan \left( \theta \right)} \label{idealForce}
		\end{align}
	
		where $\psi_x$ is the inclination of pipe in the vertical plane, worked out from \hyperref[pipeX]{Equation \ref*{pipeX}}.
		\\
		However, when the pipe inclination is zero - i.e travelling in a horizontal direction - \hyperref[idealForce]{Equation \ref*{idealForce}} breaks down and the required force $F$ becomes $0$.
		The required normal force when travelling in the horizontal pipe is the weight $W$.
		Thus the new equation for the normal force:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{split}
				N &= \left( N_{max} - W \right) \sin \left( \psi_x \right) + W
				\\
				&= \frac{2 F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)}	
			\end{split}
			\\
			N_{max} &= \frac{W}{3 \mu_{t,p}}
			\\
			\implies \frac{2 F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)} &= W \sin \left( \psi_x \right) \left( \frac{1}{3 \mu_{t,p}} - 1 \right)  + W
			\intertext{Thus the equation for $F$ becomes:}
			F &= \frac{ W \cos \left( \phi \right)}{ 2 \tan \left( \theta \right) } \left( \sin \left( \psi_x \right) \left( \frac{1}{3 \mu_{t,p}} - 1 \right) + 1 \right)
		\end{align}
		\\
		Thus, if the weight of the robot is known, and the pipe inclination $\psi_x$ is estimated, as well as measuring the leg and foot angles $ \theta \ \& \ \phi$, the required actuator force can be estimated.
		This means that the robot can set a target actuator force at all times in order to ensure that it able to traverse the pipe.
		\\
		While sensors were initially considered to work out the pipe diameter, a much simpler solution was to use the linear actuators themselves. 
		Since the required normal force is known, the actuators can be extended, updating the value of theta until the desired force is reached, using a $H_{\infty}$ controller.
		Thus, the force can be controlled to the point where the target value is reached, and the pipe diameter can be estimated by finding the base angle $\theta$.
	
		\begin{align}
			\cos \left( \theta \right) &= \cos \left( \theta_{min} \right) + \frac{E}{L}
			\intertext{where E is the extension of a single actuator. \newline The pipe diameter can then be found as:}
			D_{pipe} &= D_r + \frac{3 L}{2} \sin \left( \cos ^{-1} \left( \theta \right) \right)
			\\
			&= D_r + \frac{3 L}{2} \sin \left( \cos ^{-1} \left( \cos \left( \theta_{min} \right) + \frac{E}{L} \right) \right)
		\end{align}
		
		\hyperref[legDiagram]{Figure \ref*{legDiagram}} is reproduced as \hyperref[legDiagramRep]{Figure \ref*{legDiagramRep}} for reference of variables used.

			\label{legDiagramRep}			
		\end{figure}
	
		 $H_{\infty}$ control was chosen as the system dynamics can be well modelled for the extension of the leg, and fast performance is required.
		 This is because too little normal force is possible catastrophic, if the robot is travelling up a steeply inclined pipe, and too much normal force for too long could damage critical components.
		 While the system is non-linear, most of the variables simply contribute as fixed values, with the system only being non-linear in $\theta$.
		 However, in the region $10^\circ - 60^\circ, \sin \left( \theta \right)$ is relatively linear, so a linear control method was chosen.
		
		\subsection[Bend Behaviour]{Bend Behaviour - Jim Laney}
		
		The robot requires knowledge of where it is in the pipe, and being able to calculate the position of bends in the pipe is important.
		The robot is designed to travel around bends autonomously, and then report back to the mapping software that it has turned a bend, as well as calculating the angle turned through.
		When turning a bend, the robot uses angular encoders at the end of each leg to tell the individual leg bends $\phi_T$, $\phi_L$ \& $\phi_R$.
		These are detected from angular encoders connected to each leg link which are averaged, so $\phi_L = \frac{\phi_{L1} + \phi_{L2}}{2}$ and equivalent for the other legs.
		The robot can then vary the speed of the tracks at the end of each leg in order to try and get the angles to be parallel, such that $\phi_L = \phi_R = \phi_T$.
		This is done by setting the top leg angle $\phi_T$ as a reference, and controlling the speed using the difference between this and $\phi_R$ or $\phi_L$ with a PID controller.
		This controller only needs a very low natural frequency, as faster changes in the angle are probably due to surface unevenness, which should be dealt with by the active compliance joint.
		\\
		The robot is able to estimate the magnitude of the bend angle based on the distance travelled and the pipe diameter.
		If the bend is in the horizontal plane, as shown in \hyperref[pipeAngle]{Figure \ref*{pipeAngle}(i)}, the robot has to look at the differences between the non vertical legs in order to determine bend angles and directions.
		The robot integrates the speed of each track over the travel of the robot in order to determine the distance travelled.
		When there is disparity between the measured distance by each of the legs, but all tracks are travelling at the same speed, it can be concluded that a bend has been turned, and the robot is again travelling straight.
		Once the bend angle has been determined, this difference can be subtracted in order to realign the values of the track distances covered so that future bends can be identified.
		The inclination calculation also returns the angle of the pipe, which can be used to check the calculations, and ensure that the signs of the calculated bends are correct.
		\\
		If the leg rotation angle $\lambda = 90^\circ$, so that the side legs form a plane across the diameter of the pipe, the angle change can simply be found by using
		\begin{align}
			d_{inner} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c  - \frac{ D_{pipe} }{2} \right)
			\\
			d_{outer} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c  + \frac{ D_{pipe} }{2} \right)
			\\
			\implies \Delta d &= \theta_{bend} D_{pipe}
		\end{align}
		where d is the distance calculated from the integration of the track speed.
		\\
		The robot legs are typically not going to be in this position, so instead the value of $\lambda$ needs to be factored in, which can be achieved by adjusting the effective pipe diameter:
		\begin{align}
			D_{eff} &= D_{pipe} \sin \left( \lambda \right)
			\\
			\Delta d &= \theta_{bend} D_{eff}
			\\
			\Delta d &= \theta_{bend} D_{pipe} \sin \left( \lambda \right)
			\intertext{Thus the bend angle in the horizontal plane can be caluclated as}
			\theta_{bend} &= \frac{d_{left} - d_{right}}{D_{pipe} \sin \left( \lambda \right)}
		\end{align}
		This means that the angle $\lambda$ cannot be $180^\circ$, since this would result in the angle being incalculable, since there is no differential between the two rotating tracks.
		However, this position is obviously not possible, as the tracks cannot occupy the same space, and thus there will always be a differential to calculate the bend angle over.
		\\
		If the bend is instead in the vertical plane, also shown as \hyperref[pipeAngle]{Figure \ref*{pipeAngle}(i)}, only the top leg's distance will be different, as the two side legs should be moving around an equally long path.
		The bend angle can thus be found by comparing the distance of the outer leg with the distance of the side legs, which must again be adjusted for $\lambda$.
		Assuming an upwards bend:
		\begin{align}
			d_{top} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c  - \frac{ D_{pipe} }{2} \right)
			\\
			d_{side} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c + \frac{D_{pipe} \cos \left( \lambda \right)} {2} \right)
			\\
			\Delta d &= \theta_{bend} \frac{ D_{pipe} \left( 1 + \cos \left( \lambda \right) \right)}{2}
			\\
			\implies \theta_{bend} &= \frac{2 \left( d_{right} - d_{top} \right)}{D_{pipe} \left( 1 + \cos \left( \lambda \right) \right)}
		\end{align}
		While the horizontal and vertical bend cases have been calculated, it is also possible for bends to at an angle somewhere between the two.
		If this angle is called $\xi$, as labelled in \hyperref[pipeAngle]{Figure \ref*{pipeAngle}(ii)}, all distances travelled can be calculated as:
		\begin{align}
			d_{top} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c - \frac{D_{pipe} \cos \left( \xi \right)}{2} \right) \label{d_top}
			\\
			d_{left} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c +  \frac{D_{pipe} \cos \left( \lambda + \xi \right)}{2} \right) \label{d_left}
			\\
			d_{right} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c +  \frac{D_{pipe} \cos \left( \lambda - \xi \right)}{2} \right) \label{d_right}
		\end{align}
		This can be solved computationally using the MATLAB symbolic toolbox function \verb|solve()| to find that:	
		\fontsize{10}{\baselineskip}
		\begin{align}
			&\theta_{bend} = \frac{ \sec \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2 \sqrt{ \left( d_{left} - d_{right} \right)^2 +  \tan \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2 \left[ \left( d_{left} + d_{right} \right)^2 + 4 d_{top} \left( d_{top} - d_{left} - d_{right} \right) \right] } }{2 D_{pipe} \tan \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)} \label{generalTheta}
			\\
			&\xi = 2 \tan^{-1} \left( \tan \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right) \left[\frac{ \theta_{bend} D_{pipe}}{2} + \frac{\left( d_{left}^2 - d_{right}^2 \right) \sec \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^4 - d_{top} \left(4 + \left( d_{left} - d_{right} \right) \sec \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2 \right)}{2 \left( d_{left} - d_{right} \right) \sec \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2} \right] \right) \label{alphaEq}
		\end{align}
		\fontsize{11}{\baselineskip}
		The sign of $\theta_{bend}$ can be determined by considering the sign of the differences between the top, left and right legs.
		The leg which is on the outside of the bend will have the longest path, and the one which is on the inside will travel the shortest, which will help differentiate between the different values of $\xi$ \& $\theta_{bend}$.
		This can then also be combined with the detected inclination to ensure the robot is aware of whether it is travelling upwards or downwards as a secondary check.
		\\
		\hyperref[alphaEq]{Equation \ref*{alphaEq}} is derived from a constraint that specified that the difference between $\xi$ and the right hand side is a multiple of $2 \pi$ (in radians).
		Since $\xi$ is limited between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, which are both less than $2 \pi$, this constraint sets the value of $\xi - (\ref*{alphaEq}) = 0$, allowing us to calculate $\xi$ directly as in \hyperref[alphaEq]{Equation \ref*{alphaEq}}.
		\\
		\hyperref[generalTheta]{Equation \ref*{generalTheta}} can be validated by substituting in the previously explored cases.
		\\
		In the case of a horizontal bend, $d_{left} + d_{right} = 2 r_c \theta_{bend} $ and $d_{top} = r_c \theta_{bend}$.
		\hyperref[generalTheta]{Equation \ref*{generalTheta}} then becomes:
		\begin{align*}
			\theta_{bend} &= \frac{ \sec \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2 \sqrt{ \left( d_{left} - d_{right} \right)^2 +  \tan \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2 \left[ \left( 2 r_c \theta_{bend} \right)^2 + 4 r_c \theta_{bend} \left( r_c \theta_{bend}  - 2 r_c \theta_{bend} \right) \right] } }{2 D_{pipe} \tan \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)}
			\\
			&= \frac{d_{left} - d_{right}}{2 D_{pipe} \cos \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)}
			\\
			\theta_{bend} &= \frac{d_{left} - d_{right}}{D_{pipe} \sin \left( \lambda \right)}
		\end{align*}
		For the vertical bend case, $d_{left} = d_{right}$, so the equation for $\theta_{bend}$ is:
		\begin{align*}
			\theta_{bend} &= \frac{ \sec \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2 \sqrt{ \tan \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2 \left[ \left( 2 d_{right} \right)^2 + 4 d_{top} \left( d_{top} - 2 d_{right} \right) \right] } }{2 D_{pipe} \tan \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)}
			\\
			&= \frac{2 \left( d_{right} - d_{top} \right)}{2 D_{pipe} \cos \left( \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)^2}
			\\
			\theta_{bend} &= \frac{2 \left( d_{right} - d_{top} \right)}{D_{pipe} \left( 1 + \cos \left( \lambda \right) \right)}
		\end{align*}
		Thus, the computationally derived equation is valid for the simple cases already analysed, which suggests that the equation is accurate.
		The robot can now use this equation to quickly estimate the angle of the bend which the robot has just travelled around based on the track differentials.
		 		
		\subsection[Active Compliance Joint]{Active Compliance Joint - Jim Laney}
		
		The active compliance joint acts to ensure that the surface area contact with the wall is maximised at all times.
		In order for this to work, the robot needs to estimate the required angle of the front joint.
		\\
		If the foot angle $\phi$ is negative, then the robot knows that no action is required, as the robot is in a concave section and the flexing and returning will be maintained by the torsional spring.
		However, if the angle $\phi$ is positive, the robot know it is going over a bump, and a rotation of the front track is necessary.
		\\
		The robot must actuate the servo motor until the current required increases above a certain limit, as this will occur when the track has hit a physical barrier, the pipe wall.
		As well as doing this with a control system, there should also be a electrical short circuit to bypass the motor if any large currents are required, in order to prevent damage.
		The servo motor then maintains the angle, and only needs to change it if the current is no longer at the level determined to mean that the front track is in contact with the pipe wall.
		\\
		In this position, the robot needs to determine whether the angle needs to be increased or decreased, in order to maintain contact.
		Since it is preferable to have the flattest track profile, if the angle $\phi$ has not increased, or has decreased, then the robot will assume that the pipe has flattened out, and will attempt to return the front track to being parallel with the back two.
		If instead the angle $\phi$ has become greater, the robot will once again increment the servo motor, to attempt to make contact with the pipe surface.
		\\
		The angle of the front track also needs to be limited, to prevent over rotation which could cause damage.
		Since this method is designed to cover small levels of unevenness in the pipe wall, as well as providing better grip around bends, the maximum angle to be expected can be estimated through experimentation.
		However, a limit of $45^\circ$ seems sensible as a first estimate without further testing and examination of pipe conditions.
				
		\subsection{Crack \& Corrosion Detection}
		
		\subsection{Mapping and Location}
		
		\subsection[Communications]{Communications - Louis Emmanuel}
		
		As described in communications hardware, the above ground receivers must detect the ELF electromagnetic waves from the emitter in order to localise the robot.
		This presents a challenge as the waves that pass through the pipe wall are heavily attenuated. 
		Therefore, in order to accurately localise the robot, the received waves must first be pre-processed in order to extract the emitted signal and minimise the amount of noise.
		\\
	    \hspace*{3ex}\hyperref[ELFAttenuation]{Figure \ref*{ELFAttenuation}}  demonstrates a finite element analysis of the amplitudes of the ELF signals along the X-axis, changing with the pipe wall thickness and burial depth.
	    The thickness and burial depth is set to a linear scale, while the magnetic flux density is set to a logarithmic scale.
	    The figure highlights that the amplitude decreases logarithmically as the thickness and burial depth increase linearly.

		\textbf{Solutions}
		
		\textbf{Filter}:
        One potential solution in order to overcome this challenge is the use of a simple filter and amplifier circuit.
        The sensors are wide-band antennas and many other frequency components are received together. This is a problem as low signal to noise ratio is a disadvantage for tracing and localization algorithm.
        Therefore, band-pass filter with high gain and high quality factor is one possible solution.
        \\
        \hspace*{3ex}\hyperref[filterDesign]{Figure \ref*{filterDesign}} highlights the function of a sensor circuit. 
        The output of the sensor is sent to filter and amplifier to detect the useful signal. 
        In this system, five-grade active filter is designed in order to get high gain and advanced quality.
        The filter consists of five segments including amplifier I (high pass filter), band pass filter I, amplifier II (band pass filter), band pass filter II and amplifier III (high pass filter).
        The output signal then consists of the emitted signal separated from the other frequency components. 
        
        \begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=1.5]{Filtering.jpg}
			\caption{Filter Design}
			\label{filterDesign}
		\end{figure}
		
		Unfortunately, in order to attain a more ideal filter, a higher order filter must be used.
		This presents an issue as the impulse response is longer which pushes the latency higher and hence decreases accuracy in localisation. 
		Another issue is demonstrated in \hyperref[SNRPower]{Figure \ref*{SNRPower}}.
		The normalized power spectrum of three different signals, including noiseless ELF signals, narrow-band noise and ELF signals with noise are shown. 
		Since the frequency of narrow-band noise is concentrated at 23 Hz, it is difficult to discriminate between ELF signals and noise by frequency domain, which indicates that the frequency-domain information may not be useful for the detection. 
		Thus, the performance of the time-frequency analysis based filtering method is lower than a time-domain characteristic based FDT method.

         \begin{figure}[h]

		\end{figure}
	    
	    \textbf{Fast Decision Tree (FDT)}:
		Following the argument against the time-frequency based method outlined above, an improved solution is a time-domain method followed using a Fast Decision Tree. 
		\\
    	\hspace*{3ex}The overall architecture of the algorithm is shown in \hyperref[FDTFlowcahrt]{Figure \ref*{FDTFlowcahrt}}. 
    	Firstly, a data fusion model was implemented in order to get a better signal representation by fusing the envelope decay rates through a least squares method. 
    	In this case, the envelope decay rates are the rate of the decay of the envelopes of the received X and Y axis ELF signals. 
    	Then, a Fast Decision Tree (FDT) algorithm is proposed to detect the ELF signals. 
    	The FDT first estimates the fused envelope decay rate to maximize the orthogonal signal power of ELF signals, and the maximized orthogonal signal power is used as the test statistic for the signal detection, which provides an excellent detection performance.
        
         \begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[scale=0.12]{FDT.png}
			\caption{Flow chart of FDT method }
			\label{FDTFlowcahrt}
		\end{figure}
		
		One of the main advantages of this approach is the low latency. 
		The fast calculation process of the FDT method removes the need for large matrix multiplication in the frequency domain. 
		This is particularly important as relaying the robots position as fast as possible ensures the GPS position it receives is as accurate as possible. 
		\\
    	\hspace*{3ex}Through following a time-domain method, the analysis of the normalized power spectrum suggests that it will improve detection performance over a time-frequency domain method. 
    	This is validated through field testing on a PIG containing an ELF transmitter of frequency 23Hz. 
    	Upon testing, the FDT method is close to the upper theoretical bound and the difference between them is less than 5\%  when SNR is 0 dB.
    	The experimental results further validate that the proposed FDT method can detect the short transient very weak ELF signals in real time. 
    	Based on these results, the proposed FDT method is validated to be effective in real-time pre-processing of the signal for localisation uses.
		
	\section{Estimated Cost \& Weight}
		
		In order to estimate the cost of the robot it was necessary to select some sample components which are discussed below.
		These components also provided a reference point for the weight of the robot, allowing us to consider the requirements for forces and evaluate the likelihood of the robot causing damage to the piping system.
		
		% Also get estimated weight from selected components?
		\subsection[Locomotion]{Locomotion - Jim Laney}
		
		In order to determine suitable components, the main parts of the locomotion system which require acquisition must be considered.
		The parts which will be considered here are the track modules, the linear actuators, the internal rotation motors and the legs and gears.
		\\
		For the track module, the best reference point was the Inuktun Minitrac, a larger version of the Inuktun Microtrac module used by Ciszewski et al.\textsuperscript{\cite{ciszewski2015design}} for their testing of a pipe inspection robot.
		These cost $£ \ xxx$ each, and three are required for each leg of the robot, bringing the overall cost to $£ \ 9xxx$.
		They are probably over specified, as each has a pull rating of roughly $30$ kg for continuous duty, meaning the robot can weight up to $270$ kg, which would be an unrealistic and impractical figure to aim for\textsuperscript{\cite{inuktunTracks}}.
		Each module can be provided in either aluminium, brass or steel, with the main difference being the weight.
		Aluminium was chosen, as it is the lightest of the three, but each module still weighs $5.7$ kg taking the track weight to $51.3$ kg for all 9 track modules.
		As this is quite heavy, a different design could be considered, with a motor driving the tracks instead, so a new system can be designed to minimise the weight.
		Additionally, while discussing the pricing and operation with a representative from Eddyfi Technologies, it was made clear that the Minitrac is no longer for sale for commercial uses, as they found that they were often being used in products which compete with Eddyfi's own pipe inspection robots.
		However, these track modules give a reasonable indication of the eventual cost to expect for the robot.
		\\
		The sample linear actuators chosen were selected as they have $200$N of force output and a potentiometer to measure the extension of the actuator\textsuperscript{\cite{rsproLinear}}.
		Using \hyperref[maxWeight]{Equation \ref*{maxWeight}}, reproduced below, values for the worst case scenario can be estimated.
		\begin{align*}
			W &= \frac{6 \mu_{t,p} F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)}
		\end{align*}
		The worst case scenario occurs when when $ \mu = 1.21$\textsuperscript{\cite{sato2011development}}, $\theta = 10^\circ$ and $\phi = 0^\circ$, as stated before.
		This gives us a maximum weight of $528.5 N = 53.9$ kg, which is quite large, although comparatively small compared to the estimated weight of 9 Inuktun MiniTrac modules, hence why they would be considered inappropriate.
		With a safety margin of 1.5 for the linear actuator output, limiting their output to $130 N$, the maximum weight becomes $343.5 N = 35.0$ kg which is still reasonable and significantly larger than similar robots.
		These cost $£ \ 121.46 - £ \ 132.02$ each depending on quantity, but the lower price can be used as this is for 10 or more actuators, which is less than 2 robots. 
		Thus the actuator cost for a single robot would be $£ \ 728.76$ since 2 linear actuators are used for each leg, meaning a total of 6.
		The overall weight of these linear actuators would be $0.504$ kg, which is negligible compared to the weight of most of the other components, as well as the estimated weight of the robot shell.
		\\
		The next part to consider is the motor used for rotation of the legs relative to the body. There is no specifications required for this at the moment, but a high torque motor would be ideal.
		A sample product which is both relatively small and high torque was selected\textsuperscript{\cite{rsproRotation}} as it has a maximum output torque (at stall) of $1.46$ Nm.
		The diameter of the actual motor is only $42.8$ mm, meaning that there is plenty of space to use a larger more powerful motor if testing reveals that it will be necessary.
		The cost of these drives is $£ \ 141.84$ per motor, and 2 are required for the main body of the robot.
		Since similar motors could be used as the RC servo motors in the active compliance joint, another 3 would be included in the robot, bringing the total cost for 5 rotation motors to $£ \ 709.20$.

		The remaining components of the locomotion system were estimated using the 3D CAD models, shown in \hyperref[gearCAD]{Figures \ref*{gearCAD}, \ref*{shortLinkCAD} \& \ref*{longLinkCAD}} to estimate their volume.
		The leg pieces were assumed to be made out of stainless steel, and the gear was to be made of aluminium.
		The density of stainless steel is $7900$ kg m\textsuperscript{-3}\textsuperscript{\cite{HLT}}, so the longer link weighs $0.653$ kg and the shorter link weighs $0.350$ kg.
		Thus, a single leg, which is made up of 2 short links and 2 longer links, weighs $2.00$ kg, bringing the total contribution of the three legs to $6.02$ kg for the whole robot.
		The density of aluminium was assumed to be $2700$ kg m\textsuperscript{-3}\textsuperscript{\cite{HLT}}, which makes the weight of a single gear $3.42$ kg, and there are 4 inside the robot, bring the total weight up to $13.68$ kg
		This could be mitigated by refining the design, as this is a very rough sketch of the gear, and is probably thicker than would be necessary in reality.

	\section{Industry Analysis}
		
		It was decided to use the Porter's Five Forces model\textsuperscript{\cite{porter2008five}} to analyse the in-pipe inspection robot industry, in order to provide a systematic analysis of the existing and possible threats to the company in the future.
		
		\subsection[Threat of Entry]{Threat of New Entry}
				
		\subsection[Power of Suppliers]{Power of Suppliers - Jim Laney}
			
			The power of suppliers in the in-pipe robotics industry is typically very minimal, due to the large number of substitutes for a given product.
			As an example,the components selected for the robot will be used to evaluate the overall power which suppliers hold in the industry.
			\\
			The non electrical components, such as the robot body, robot legs and leg gears are all made of either aluminium or steel, which are readily available from many sources, meaning it is very difficult for a single supplier to exert any influence over the user.
			Similarly, all of the generic electrical components, such as the motors used for rotating the legs and eventually the wheels, the linear actuators and different sensors used for measuring the position of the robot are easily replaced, as there are many suppliers of similar products.
			There are some specific products, such as the industrial cameras, AHRS and the laser scanner, which have far fewer substitutes, due to their more specialised nature, but these still can be replaced with competitive products relatively easily without making major changes to the robot.
			\\
			The other electronics, such as the graphical processing unit (GPU) and  also have alternatives to a greater or lesser degree.
			There are not many major GPU manufacturers, with AMD, Nvidia and Intel dominating the commercial market\textsuperscript{\cite{rake2020graphic}} due to long term presence in the market.
			Thus these manufacturers have greater power over companies which have on board image processing, and can dictate the cost and functionality of  products.
			As such, these suppliers offer the greatest threat to the in-pipe robotics industry.
			\\
			Within the fibre optic industry in the UK there are only 3 major companies\textsuperscript{\cite{neve2020fibreoptic}}, which have a total market share of $22.8$\%, but of these only Leviton and Prysmian are possible suppliers.
			The rest of the industry is made up of much smaller firms who supply niche products for optical fibres, so there are a maximum of 3 or 4 suppliers.
			This means that these companies will also exert significant pressure on the in pipe robotics industry, but still do not have the level of influence that the GPU manufacturers do.
			\\
			Finally, the threat of forward vertical integration is practically non-existent, due to the large variety of suppliers.
			While there are a few key suppliers who exert significant influence over the industry, none of these are in a position to easily move into the in-pipe inspection industry as they would be required to have many of the same suppliers that current companies do.
					
		\subsection[Power of Buyers]{Power of Buyers}
		
		\subsection[Threat of Substitutes]{Threat of Substitutes - Jim Laney}
			
			The threat of substitutes in the in-pipe inspection robot industry is medium, as there are many established substitutes which currently dominate pipe inspection services.
			\\
			The main threat is the manual inspection of pipelines as these can inspect all kinds of pipes, just like robotic solutions and have a much lower up front cost.
			As well as this, manual inspection has the advantage of familiarity as it is an established practice which gas pipe companies know they can rely on.
			Manual inspection uses different methods for inspecting pipes dependent on the the kind of damage being inspected for.
			\\
			For external corrosion inspection, a pre-assessment is performed, followed by both indirect and direct inspection techniques being used, the latter of which requires excavation to occur for that section of the pipe\textsuperscript{\cite{kishawy2010review}}. 
			For internal corrosion inspection, a similar process is followed, with pipes that have the greatest inclination being inspected first to identify the location of localised corrosion. 
			However, both these methods require excavation in order to confirm the location of the corrosion, which is disruptive, especially in urban environments.
			\\
			When checking for cracks manual inspection can typically only find these when a leak has occurred, as there is otherwise very little change in behaviour of the gas inside the pipe.
			Thus, manual methods rely on constant assessment of conditions within the pipe, such as the mass-balance method, pressure-drop method and using gas smelling dogs\textsuperscript{\cite{kishawy2010review}}.
			Ground penetrating radar is also used as another method for looking for cracks without excavation, but visual inspection is also typically used to ensure accuracy of the readings, which does require excavation.
			Computer models can also be used to predict the behaviour of the pipeline in order to predict faults, but as this requires modelling of complex fluid dynamics, these are not always reliable.
			\\
			Pipeline Inspection Gauges (PIGs) are the other main substitute to robotic in-pipe inspection, as these are passive devices which are forced along the pipeline by the gas flow.
			However, PIGs are uncontrollable and cannot operate in pipelines containing sharp bends\textsuperscript{\cite{mills2017advances}}, making them unsuitable for urban pipelines.
			As such the threat from PIGs is minimal since the robot has been specifically chosen to enter an area where they are not currently suitable, although it is possible that more advanced PIGs may be developed in the future which could compete in urban pipelines.
		
		\subsection[Rivalry Among Existing Competitors]{Rivalry Among Existing Competitors - Louis Emanuel}
		High intensity of competitive rivalry can make an industry more competitive and thus decrease profit potential for the existing firms. This section will serve to analyse the level of competitive rivalry that our robot would face in the in-pipe inspection robot industry. \\
        \hspace*{3ex}There are a number of different factors that determine the level of competitive rivalry such as concentration in industry, switching costs, differentiation, and exit barriers. And hence this section is structured to consider each of them in turn. 
        
        \textbf{Concentration in industry}\\
        If an industry has a high number of competing firms with similar offerings, the level of competitive rivalry will be high. In comparison, a monopoly market structure is dominated by a low number of firms and will exhibit less rivalry. Consequently, the level of market concentration significantly impacts the competitive rivalry.\\
        \hspace*{3ex}In our case, there are a low number of firms currently operating in the autonomous in-pipe inspection market. With the only significant competitor being ULC Robotic’s CISBOT. However, if we consider the whole pipe inspection market, there are a significant number of similar sized competitors that use PIG technology including SGS, Pigtek LTD and Propipe among others. PIG technology does not have automated capabilities, and so its product offering is significantly different than the one we are proposing. Therefore, given the only competitor with similar offerings is Cadent, the market exhibits a monopoly structure and suggest a low intensity of rivalry.
        
        \textbf{Switching Costs}\\
        Aside from fixed costs, switching costs also influence the extent of rivalry as high switching costs in an industry will lead to a decrease in competitive rivalry. These switching costs arise from the fact that customers who have invested a lot of resources in learning to use a product will find it costly to switch to a competitor. \\
        \hspace*{3ex}The impact of switching costs on competitive rivalry depends entirely on the business model of our robot. For example, an outsourcing approach in which the customer hires the robot and an operating team will have far lower switching costs than purchasing the robot outright and training an internal team to operate it. Looking at current competitors, ULC’s CISBOT is not sold outright, but operates using service contracts. Therefore, the switching costs are currently low in the industry which suggests a higher intensity of rivalry. Although, this may be favourable for a new entrant. 

        \textbf{Differentiation}\\
        The degree of differentiation also determines how intense the competition will be. If a firm in the market is offering highly differentiated products that other organizations cannot easily imitate or copy, then it will face relatively less competition.\\
        \hspace*{3ex}Again, considering the overall in-pipe inspection market, since PIG’s are incapable of currently operating in the urban pipeline environment our robot will be inspecting, we have a distinct differentiated capability. However, Cadent is capable of operating in this environment and also offers a pipe fixing capability. Whilst our robot does not offer this, it does offer automated capabilities and at a significantly lower price. Therefore, given our different offering to current firms in the industry, we would expect a lower threat of rivalry. 
        
        \textbf{Fixed Costs}\\
        The specific costs a firm faces to operate in a market can also affect how intense the threat of rivalry is. Costs that can increase rivalry include high fixed costs and high storage expenses. To cover these, competitors in a market will need to operate at high capacity and this is likely to intensify competition.\\
        \hspace*{3ex}Considering the in-pipe inspection market, the small size of robots and PIG’s means that only a small amount of storage space is needed. Also, the small production volumes suggest that the manufacturing resources required are low. However, one significant fixed cost for the industry may be interest payments associated with creating the robots. Given the complex technology, robots like CISBOT are priced at \$1 million. This could be problematic as given the service contract business model it operates, this investment will likely not be recuperated for a significant period of operation. Despite this, the robot we offer is far cheaper and so the contribution of costs to the threat of rivalry are low. 
        
        \textbf{Conclusion}\\
        Overall, from an analysis of the key factors that Porter outlined as contributing to a high level of rivalry, the threat level is determined as low. The only exception being the low switching costs currently in the industry. However, for our robot attempting to penetrate the market, this factor may be favourable due to the current monopoly CISBOT has. Given this low threat of rivalry, we can conclude that the industry has a high profit potential.
       
        
        


		
	\section{Customer Industry Analysis}
		% Insert Monty's P5F here
		Since there is only one customer industry, it is important to analyse the safety and sustainability of that industry to ensure that the business was secure.

	\section{Stakeholder Analysis}
	
		The main stakeholders for the project are individually analysed below.
		There were 3 major stakeholders identified - gas distributors, regulatory bodies and traditional inspection \& maintenance companies - and 3 minor stakeholders identified - gas suppliers, local councils and the general public.
		
		\subsection[Gas Distributors]{Gas Distributors}
		
		\subsection[Regulatory Bodies]{Regulatory Bodies - Jim Laney}
			
			The main regulatory bodies to consider are the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), the Energy Networks Association (ENA) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
			As well as this, regulations enforced by the Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers (IGEM) and the International Standards Organisation (ISO) are also of interest.
 			\\
			OFGEM is the UK government body which provides codes and regulations for the gas pipeline companies to follow, but these are mainly focused on reducing competition between gas transporters and ensuring a fair playing field for all companies.
			The Uniform Network Code (UNC)\textsuperscript{\cite{joint2005uniform}} covers the transition from a single national system to the current 4 provider network, as well as the rights of customers and independent gas transporters.
			The UNC also ensure that there is a fair market and safe operation for the gas pipe system, as well as encouraging the implementation of robust computer systems and daily energy balancing.
			While the safety sections of the UNC could be relevant to the robot, they are far too general, and are simply an overview of the responsibilities of the gas providers to ensure safe pipelines.
			The Independent Gas Transporter Uniform Network Code (iGT UNC)\textsuperscript{\cite{igt2021independent}} defines more about the interrelations between different smaller, independent providers and helps to standardise the interactions with gas providers.
			It refers to the UNC in large part, but focuses more on the responsibilities of Independent Transporters who are not the customers for the robot, and as such do not need to be focused on.
			The Supply Point Administration Agreement (SPAA)\textsuperscript{\cite{spaa2021supply}} is about supplier-supplier relationships which may not be covered by existing contracts, and contributes to the smooth running of the industry, and allows for smooth transfer of customers between different gas carriers.
			Finally, the Smart Energy Code (SEC)\textsuperscript{\cite{smart2021smart}} defines the rights and obligations of energy suppliers, transmission companies and other companies involved in metering in Great Britain.
			Since inspection of the pipeline is the main focus of the robot, the rights given by the SEC are not a concern.
			\\
			OFGEM also awards money to companies which they believe are innovating in new technologies as part of the National Innovation Competition (NIC).
			The NIC provides up to £20 million funding for innovation in the gas energy networks, although in 2020 £27.17 million was awarded under plans to move to increase overall funding to £28 million\textsuperscript{\cite{ofgem2020nic}}.
			However it also significantly easier to get the gas funding than electricity funding as the competition is significantly smaller - in 2020 there were only 2 applications, both of which were funded.
			Thus providing a compelling reason for the robot to receive NIC funding will be incredibly important in order to secure funding for development.
			\\
			The ENA is the industry body for all the energy suppliers in the UK \& Ireland, allowing them to publish all their own guidance as to what is required to operate safely within pipes.
			For the gas industry, these fall under the Gas Industry Standards (GIS), which define both how the robot can operate within pipes as well as how the pipes should be built and maintained.
			However, most of these standards refer to traditional methods of pipe inspection and as such are not directly applicable to the robot.
			The most likely to affect the robot design is GIS/F10:2015 “Ancillary fittings used for the live insertion of gas mains operating at pressures equal to or less than 75 mbar”\textsuperscript{\cite{energy2015gas}}.
			GIS/F10:2015 describes how the insertion of polyethylene pipes into steel gas mains must be performed on low pressure lines, which may provide guidance on the insertion of the robot into similar pipes.
			However the pipes specified by 	GIS/F10:2015 are 8 inches (203.2 mm) in diameter, which is much smaller than the pipes the robot is designed to operate in and operating pressures are higher, so this standard will be of limited use.
			\\
			The HSE is the government agency responsible for the regulation of workplace safety, and as such provides information on how to ensure safe working conditions in and around gas pipelines.
			They provide guidance and interpretation\textsuperscript{\cite{books1996guide}} of the Pipeline Safety Regulations 1996, allowing us to more easily select the most important regulations for the robot to follow.
			The regulations which apply to us most clearly are Regulations 10, 15 and 16, with regulation 28 encouraging gas transporters to do their due diligence to ensure that outside companies do not cause an unsafe pipeline.
			Regulations 10 ("The operator shall ensure that modification, maintenance or other work on a pipeline is carried out in such a way that its soundness and fitness for the purpose for which it has been designed will not be prejudiced") and 15 ("No person shall cause such damage to a pipeline as may give rise to a danger to persons") are similar as both cover the obligation of the robot to avoid causing damage to the pipe.
			The HSE also clarifies that this means that testing must be undertaken with a standardised pipe to ensure that the robot does not cause damage or structural instability to the pipe.
			As well as this it is necessary for us to be able to report when there is a possibility that damage to a pipeline has occurred, even when accidental, so the robot should also check for damage caused by the robot on the return journey.
			\\
			The IGEM provides technical standards for the gas industry, which are captured in several key areas.
			Based on the IGEM list of standards\textsuperscript{\cite{institution2021igem}}, as the standards themselves are not freely available, some of the Safety (SR) regulations  as well as the Transmission and Distribution (TD) standards will need to be followed
			Considering the safety regulations first, SR/22 ("Purging operations for fuel gases in transmission, distribution and storage"), covers the issues faced when removing the robot from the pipeline, and SR/28 ("Trenchless techniques") discusses methods for operating in pipes with minimal or no excavation of the surrounding area.
			The main Transmission and Distribution considerations are TD/1 ("Steel pipelines for high pressure gas transmission"), which are the main environment which the robot will be operating in, as well as TD/3 ("Steel and PE pipelines for gas distribution") and TD/4 ("PE and steel gas services and service pipework") which are more general standards for all kinds of pipeline, and may provide some requirements not captured by TD/1.
			\\
			The International Association of Oil \& Gas Producers (IOGP) provides guidance on the selection of relevant ISO standards\textsuperscript{\cite{iogp2017standards}}, which allows us to narrow down which relevant standards to consider.
			While the ISO standards are also not freely available, the ISO website provides a short summary of the main points in the standard before purchase, allowing us to evaluate which standards to consider.
			ISO 21457:2010\textsuperscript{\cite{iso21457}} is important as it identifies the possible corrosion mechanisms and parameters for prediction in pipelines.
			Thus it helps select suitable materials for the robot, in order to avoid corrosion, as well as helping to identify what corrosion signs to look for.
			Another important standard is ISO 15649:2001\textsuperscript{\cite{iso15649}} which specifies required design and construction parameters for gas pipelines, as well as requirements for pipeline inspection.
			This will greatly influence the requirements for the robot, and while many of the necessary safety features for inspection have been considered, the standard will formalise this and emphasise any which are missing.
			
		
		\subsection[Traditional  \& Autonomous Pipe Inspection Companies]{Traditional \& Autonomous Pipe Inspection Companies }
            Both traditional and autonomous gas pipe inspection companies have an active interest and influence on the operation of our autonomous pipe inspection robot as they are competitors to our product offering currently or have great potential to be in the future. Traditional gas inspection companies concern the firms such as ProPipe that operate PIG’s. Whilst autonomous inspection companies refers to the firms similar to our product offering such as CISBOT. \\
            \hspace*{3ex}The following section analyses the interest and power of these stakeholders before considering how to manage the relationships.
            
            \textbf{Interest}\\
            Firstly, considering traditional gas inspection companies, the PIG’s that are operated currently are unsuitable for use in the urban environment our robot is designed for. However, firms in the industry like ProPipe have been established since 1998 in comparison to CISBOT (2013). This extensive experience coupled with their already established customer network would facilitate a swift move into the autonomous inspection market. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe these firms are closely monitoring the developments of any firms in the market. \\
            \hspace*{3ex}Now considering the autonomous pipe inspection robots, the current market leader CISBOT has no large competitors in the London market. And so it is unlikely CISBOT has refined both its technology and business model given the monopoly it has enjoyed. Therefore, it is also reasonable to expect CISBOT and similar firms to monitor our progress in order to react and perhaps mimic the technology we offer. 
            
            \textbf{Power}\\
            Traditional gas inspection companies have negligible power. In other words, they hold no influence over the success of our robot. This is due to the fact they currently operate in a different market. However, it is worth noting that these firms may occasionally share the same customers as our robot for operation in non-urban areas. \\
            \hspace*{3ex}Autonomous pipe inspection companies on the other hand have more power. For example, a marketing plan may be designed to capture market share or reinforce customer loyalty in the face of competition from a new robot entering the market. Strategies such as these will have a direct impact on the success of our robot. 
            
            \textbf{Stakeholder management}\\
            Traditional gas inspection companies have a medium interest and low power relationship with our robot. Therefore, a keep informed approach will be taken in order to ensure that no major issues arise. This is important as through having a pre-existing relationship with a potential future competitor, we can anticipate their future plans and develop strategies that could create competitive advantage in the future. Additionally, given the relationship these firms may have with some of our customers, it is important to ensure no problems arise. \\
            \hspace*{3ex}Autonomous inspection companies have a high interest and medium power relationship with our robot. It is therefore suggested that consultation is carried out with these firms. This is valuable as it will enable us to monitor trends and share mutually beneficial knowledge. Further, establishing relationships with existing competitors can aid with the understanding and development of the complex regulation in the industry.

            
            


		
		\subsection[Gas Suppliers]{Gas Suppliers}
		
		\subsection[Local Councils]{Local Councils - Jim Laney}
			
			Local councils are a stakeholder since they are required to organise the excavation work to inspect and repair pipes.
			As such, they would be aiming to minimise the number of inspections in their area, and would also be aiming to excavate the smallest area possible to minimise disruption.
			However they have relatively little power over the choice of inspection method used by the gas transmission companies, and as such are relatively unimportant stakeholders to impress.
			The power of local councils is also significantly reduced outside of large cities like London, where the area covered by a single council is greatly increased, and as such the amount of control they have over any single incident will be reduced.
			However, despite their smaller influence, the effect of councils is still worth considering as they may be the tipping point which causes preference over other options.
			\\
			Due to the reduced number of excavations the robot is attractive to local councils, as they do not have to excavate roads as often or as widely.
			This is a budgetary saving since, in 2018 - 2019, local councils in England spent £$3,857$ million on Highways and Transport, which will include roadworks required to access gas pipes for inspection and replacement, which makes up $4.22$\% of total service expenditure\textsuperscript{\cite{ministry2020local}}.
			As such the reduction in amount of excavation has the possibility to save a significant amount of funding in the UK, allowing for funding to be redirected to other important services such as education and fire services.
			As well as this, there is the environmental impact of traffic and excavation, which local governments are aiming to reduce, in order to meet government targets of lowered emissions.
		
		\subsection[General Public]{General Public - Louis Emanuel}
		The general public is also a stakeholder that must be carefully considered due to the fact that the robot will be operating in densely populated urban environments. The general public primarily consists of the people who are located near to the gas pipeline undergoing inspection by our robot.
		
		\textbf{Interest}
		
        The interests of the public can be broadly broken down into environmental benefits and transport disruption.\\
	    \hspace*{3ex}Environmental interests concern the potential damage posed by leaking gas pipes. For example, currently in Boston the state’s aging natural gas pipelines are riddled with about 20,000 potentially dangerous and environmentally damaging leaks, many decades old. In fact Audrey Schulman, the president of Home Energy Efficiency Team, quoted  “The leaks are potentially explosive, kill trees, harm human health, and release an extraordinarily destructive greenhouse gas”. Therefore, as with this example, it is in the general public's interest that our robot is successful. \\
        \hspace*{3ex}Similarly, the general public also has an active interest that the inspection of the pipes create minimum transport disruption. This is particularly important given the heavy traffic regions in which we will be operating. 
        
        \textbf{Power}\\
        The power of the general public over our success is very small. However, one of the few ways they could increase influence is through the formation of pressure groups. Although this is unlikely as in most cases, the general public will not even be aware that the robot is inspecting the pipes beneath their feet. The only exception to this could be in the circumstances of cases like the Boston leaks outlined above in which the high level of leaks pick up attention from the media. In this scenario, the influence would be directed to the pipeline operators who may in turn require our inspection services.
        \textbf{Stakeholder Management}\\
        
        Overall, the general public has a low interest and low influence over the success of our robot. Therefore, a monitor approach should be taken in which minimum engagement is required. The monitoring is important to recognise and predict the formation of pressure groups which may have a more significant effect on our operations.
