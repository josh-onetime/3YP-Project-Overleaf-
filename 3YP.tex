	\section{Introduction}
	
	The pipe inspection robot works in underground pipes in urban areas, with a pipe diameter from $609.6$ mm to $914.4$ mm and with pipes at any angle, providing a map of the pipe with the location of any failures to the operator. % 24 - 36 inches; Needs citation for pipe sizes?
	The robot reduces the disruption caused by having to dig up large areas of pipe for inspection, since the issue can be located and smaller, less disruptive work can be undertaken.
	It is intended to provide an inspection method for pipes which cannot be inspected by the current leading method, Pipe Inspection Gauges (PIGs), which only work in horizontal or near horizontal straight pipes\textsuperscript{\cite{mills2017advances}}.
	It enters a pipe using a launch tube, and travels autonomously along the inside of the pipe, checking for evidence of cracks and corrosion and logging their location for future maintenance.
	\\

	While inside the pipe, the robot uses three legs to maintain contact and provide the required normal force to move inside the pipe, as shown in \hyperref[3DSketch]{Figure \ref*{3DSketch}}.
	Two of these legs can be rotated to provide improved speeds over pipes at different angles, and all three legs can be extended and retracted to fit the pipe diameter the robot is currently in.
	It can navigate around bends and through pipes at different angles, without prior knowledge of the location or angle of these, and will automatically feedback to the control system in order to create an accurate map.
	\\
	The robot uses computer vision to identify cracks and corrosion, allowing it to mark where these occur for human maintenance, and then combines this with knowledge of its position to create a map of the pipe it has travelled and where issues have occurred.
	It can transmit its location using a small transmitter, which has a separate power supply so that if the robot breaks down it can be located with minimal excavation.

		\subsection{Locomotion}
			
			%By Jim
			The main locomotion of the robot is a set of 3 legs with a pantograph mechanism  to allow for the adaptation to different diameters, with tracks at the end to drive the motion, as shown in \hyperref[legDesign]{Figure \ref*{legDesign}}.
			There is one leg which remains stationary at the top of the robot, and two legs which are able to rotate about the body of the robot between $20^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ to the vertical.
			At the end of each leg there is a passive joint between the leg and the track to allow for the robot to travel along surfaces which are not perpendicular to the legs, such as around bends or over uneven surfaces.
			\\
			The length of the pantograph is controlled by the force from two opposing linear actuators, which extend to a given length to set the distance of the pantograph.
			The track at the end of the pantograph is connected to a freely turning joint, which can be measured using two angular sensors to give the angle $\phi$, shown in \hyperref[legDiagram]{Figure \ref*{legDiagram}}, with the springs acting to restore $\phi$ to $0^\circ$ when under no external effects.
			In addition to this, the tracks use an active compliance joint, as shown in \hyperref[activeCompliance]{Figures \ref*{activeCompliance} \& \ref*{unevenBehaviour}}, which allows for the robot to maintain maximum surface contact at all times.

			\end{figure}
		
			The rotation of the two base legs relative to the body of the robot occurs using a motor to drive each end of the rotation mechanism.
			The motor drives the sun gears of two planetary gear systems, shown in \hyperref[planetaryDrive]{Figure \ref*{planetaryDrive}},which rotate in opposite direction so the legs move symmetrically.
			The direction is reversed for the further planetary drive system using a small differential gearbox, shown in \hyperref[diffGearbox]{Figure \ref*{diffGearbox}}, which allows for compact reversal of motion.
			These allow the legs to move around the body, from almost directly below the robot to in a horizontal plane at $90^\circ$ to the top leg.
			As both legs are driven from the same motor at each end, both legs are symmetrical about the vertical leg at all times, and the leg position can be summarised by a single body rotation angle $\beta$, measured from the top leg, which varies from $\beta = 90^\circ$ to $\beta = 160^\circ$.
			The rotation allows the robot to adapt to different angles of the pipe more easily, as it will be quicker to drive along horizontal pipes with the almost vertical drive system, whereas vertical pipes require a more even distribution of contact points for optimal behaviour, probably requiring an angle of $\beta = 120^\circ$ for the most even distribution of contact points.

			The ratio between the longer base links of the pantograph and then shorter tip links is 2:1, which gives the greatest range of diameters for the smallest change in the base distance\textsuperscript{\cite{okada1987mogrer}}, so we can calculate the required link length $L$ to allow the robot to adapt to the chosen range of diameters, $609.6 - 914.4$ mm.
			The pantograph angles are shown in \hyperref[legDiagram]{Figure \ref*{legDiagram}}, and we can find that:
			
			\begin{align}
				r_{min} &= \frac{3L}{2} \sin \left( \theta_{min} \right)
				\\
				r_{max} &= \frac{3L}{2} \sin \left( \theta_{max} \right)
				\\
				\implies \Delta r &= \frac{3L}{2} \left( \sin \left( \theta_{max} \right) - \sin \left( \theta_{min} \right) \right)
				\\
				L &= \frac{2 \Delta r}{3 \left( \sin \left( \theta_{max} \right) - \sin \left( \theta_{min} \right) \right)}
			\end{align}
			
			If we assume that the pantograph will ideally move from an angle of $\theta_{min} = 20^\circ$ to $\theta_{max} = 60^\circ$, spanning a change in radius of 304.8 mm, we find that $L = 387.8$ mm, and our smallest leg radius $r_{min} = 199.0$ mm, not including the depth of the tracks.
			This means that, if we assume our track depth is 70 mm, our body diameter has a maximum of $376.4$ mm, setting a constraint on the dimensions of the inner body based on our design criteria.
			\\
			The minimum length of the body is also set by this, as it means that the body length $l_{min} = L \cos \left( \theta_{min} \right) = 364.4$ mm.
			A maximum body length can be found by considering the ability of the robot to turn corners inside the pipe, and it is necessary to consider how this compares to the minimum to make sure there is no loss of mobility.
			For the duration of this calculation, we will assume we are in the smallest possible pipe diameter $D_{pipe} = 609.6$ mm, and we will assume that the curvature radius $r_c = \frac{3}{2} D_{pipe} = 914.4$ mm.
			As our robot diameter $D_r \nless \left( 2 \sin \left( 45^\circ \right) - 1 \right) D_{pipe} = 252.5$ mm we can use the following equation \textsuperscript{\cite{roh2005differential}}:

			\begin{align}
				l_{max} &= 2 \sqrt{4D_{pipe}^2 - \left( D_{pipe} + D_r\right) ^ 2}
				\intertext{which, using our maximum $D_r = 436.4$ mm}
				l_{max} &= 1252.7 \ \mathrm{mm} \notag
			\end{align}
		
			We can also use \hyperref[legDiagram]{Figure \ref*{legDiagram}} to calculate the required force output of the linear actuators in order for the robot to operate at all angles.
			As such, we consider the worse case scenario, where the robot is climbing vertically, and thus must create enough normal force for friction to support its entire weight.
			We find that:
			
			\begin{align}
				N &= \frac{2 F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)}
				\\
				F_f &= \mu_{t,p} N
				\\
				&= \frac{2 \mu_{t,p} F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)}
				\intertext{where $F_f$ is the frictional force on one track, and $\mu_{t,p}$ is the coefficient of friction between the tracks and the pipe. \newline In order for this to balance the weight W:}
				W &= 3 F_f
				\\
				&= \frac{6 \mu_{t,p} F \tan \left( \theta \right)}{\cos \left( \phi \right)}
				\\
				\implies F &= \frac{W \cos \left( \phi \right)}{6 \mu_{t,p} \tan \left( \theta \right)} \label{reqMaxNorm}
			\end{align}
			
			Since testing would be required to find the greatest angle $\phi$ that is experienced by the robot in general use, as well as an estimate for the coefficient of friction $\mu_{t,p}$ it is not sensible to find an estimate for the required force without further testing.
			However, from this equation we can see that the worst case scenario is with the lowest pipe diameter, as this minimises $\theta$, and we can hypothesise that bends, where $\phi$ is likely to be the largest during normal operation, will require the most linear actuator force.

		\subsection{Bend Behaviour}
		
		The robot requires knowledge of where it is in the pipe, and being able to calculate the position of bends in the pipe is important.
		The robot is designed to travel around bends autonomously, and then report back to the mapping software that it has turned a bend, as well as calculating the angle turned through.
		When turning a bend, the robot uses angular sensors at the end of each leg to tell the individual leg bends $\phi_T, \ \phi_L \ \& \ \phi_R$.
		These are detected from angular sensor connected to each leg link which are averaged, so $\phi_L = \frac{\phi_{L1} + \phi_{L2}}{2}$ and equivalent for the other legs.
		The robot can then vary the speed of the tracks at the end of each leg in order to try and get the angles to be parallel, such that $\phi_L = \phi_R = \phi_T$.
		This is done by setting the top leg angle $\phi_T$ as a reference, and controlling the speed using the difference between this and $\phi_R$ or $\phi_L$ with a PID controller.
		This controller only needs a very low natural frequency, as faster changes in the angle are probably due to surface unevenness, which should be dealt with by the active compliance joint.
		\\
		\begin{figure}[h]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[height=\imageheight]{pipeAngle}
			\caption{Position of the robot within the pipe. (i) Within a horizontal or vertical bend, (ii) Within a bend at angle $\alpha$ to the vertical, view shown relative to the bend rather than relative to the outside world}
			\label{pipeAngle}
		\end{figure}
		The robot is able to estimate the magnitude of the bend angle based on the distance travelled and the pipe diameter.
		If the bend is in the horizontal plane, as shown in \hyperref[pipeAngle]{Figure \ref*{pipeAngle}(i)}, the robot has to look at the differences between the non vertical legs in order to determine bend angles and directions.
		The robot integrates the speed of each track over the travel of the robot in order to determine the distance travelled.
		When there is disparity between the measured distance by each of the legs, but all tracks are travelling at the same speed, it can be concluded that a bend has been turned, and the robot is again travelling straight.
		Once the bend angle has been determined, this difference can be subtracted in order to realign the values of the track distances covered so that future bends can be identified.
		\\
		If the body rotation angle $\beta = 90^\circ$, so that the side legs form a plane across the diameter of the pipe, the angle change can simply be found by using
		\begin{align}
			d_{inner} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c  - \frac{ D_{pipe} }{2} \right)
			\\
			d_{outer} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c  + \frac{ D_{pipe} }{2} \right)
			\\
			\implies \Delta d &= \theta_{bend} D_{pipe}
		\end{align}
		where d is the distance calculated from the integration of the track speed.
		\\
		The robot legs are typically not going to be in this position, so instead the $\beta$ needs to be factored in, which can be achieved by adjusting the effective pipe diameter:
		\begin{align}
			D_{eff} &= D_{pipe} \sin \left( \beta \right)
			\\
			\Delta d &= \theta_{bend} D_{eff}
			\\
			\Delta d &= \theta_{bend} D_{pipe} \sin \left( \beta \right)
			\intertext{Thus the bend angle in the horizontal plane can be caluclated as}
			\theta_{bend} &= \frac{\Delta d}{D_{pipe} \sin \left( \beta \right)}
		\end{align}
		This means that the angle $\beta$ cannot be $180^\circ$, since this would result in the angle being incalculable, since there is no differential between the two rotating tracks.
		However, this position is obviously not possible, as the tracks cannot occupy the same space, and thus there will always be a differential to calculate the bend angle over.
		\\
		If the bend is instead in the vertical plane, also shown in \hyperref[pipeAngle]{Figure \ref*{pipeAngle}(i)}, then both the bend angle detection and inclination detection systems can be used in tangent to generate a more precise estimate of the bend angle.
		Only the top leg's distance will be different, as the two side legs should be moving around an equally spaced area.
		The bend angle can thus be found by comparing the distance of the outer leg with the distance of the side legs, which must again be adjusted for $\beta$.
		Assuming an upwards bend:
		\begin{align}
			d_{top} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c  - \frac{ D_{pipe} }{2} \right)
			\\
			d_{side} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c - \frac{D_{pipe} \cos \left( \beta \right)} {2} \right)
			\\
			\Delta d &= \theta_{bend} \frac{ D_{pipe} \left( 1 - \cos \left( \beta \right) \right)}{2}
			\\
			\implies \theta_{bend} &= \frac{2 \Delta d}{D_{pipe} \left( 1 - \cos \left( \beta \right) \right)}
		\end{align}
		While we have worked out the bends in the horizontal or vertical directions, it is also possible for bends to at an angle somewhere between the two.
		If we call this angle $\alpha$, as labelled in \hyperref[pipeAngle]{Figure \ref*{pipeAngle}(ii)}, we can calculate expressions for all distances travelled:
		\begin{align}
			d_{top} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c - \frac{D_{pipe} \cos \left( \alpha \right)}{2} \right) \label{d_top}
			\\
			d_{left} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c +  \frac{D_{pipe} \sin \left( \alpha + \beta \right)}{2} \right) \label{d_left}
			\\
			d_{right} &= \theta_{bend} \left( r_c +  \frac{D_{pipe} \sin \left( \beta - \alpha \right)}{2} \right) \label{d_right}
		\end{align}
		This can be solved computationally using the MATLAB symbolic toolbox function \verb|solve()| to find that:
		\begin{align}
			\theta_{bend} = \frac{ \sqrt{ \left[ \left( d_{left} - d_{top} \right)^2 + \left( d_{right} - d_{top} \right)^2 \right] \left( 1 - \sin \left( \beta \right) \right)  + \left( d_{left} - d_{right} \right)^2 \sin \left( \beta \right) } } {D_{pipe} \sin \left( \frac{2 \beta + \pi}{4} \right) \cos \left( \beta \right)} \label{generalTheta}
			\\
			\alpha = 2 \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{\theta_{bend} D_{pipe} \cos \left( \beta \right)}{\left( d_{left} - d_{right} \right)} + \frac{\left(d_{left} + d_{right} - 2 d_{top} \right) \sin \left( \frac{\beta - \pi}{4} \right)}{\sqrt{2} \sin \left( \frac{2 \beta + \pi}{4} \right) \left( d_{left} - d_{right} \right)}\right) \label{alphaEq}
		\end{align}
		Where $\sqrt{ \ }$ is assumed to be the positive square root, since $\theta_{bend}$ is assumed to take a positive value.
		This can then be combined with the detected inclination to ensure the robot is aware of whether it is travelling upwards or downwards.
		\\
		\hyperref[generalTheta]{Equation \ref*{generalTheta}} is only valid under the conditions that:
		\begin{align*}
			2 D_{pipe} \theta_{bend} &< 2 d_{top} + D_{pipe} \theta_{bend} \cos \left( \alpha \right) \tag{\ref*{generalTheta}.1} \label{thetaCond1}
			\\
			d_{left} + d_{right} &\neq 2 d_{top} \tag{\ref*{generalTheta}.2} \label{thetaCond2}
		\end{align*}
		Considering each in turn, \hyperref[thetaCond1]{Condition \ref*{thetaCond1}} can be simplified by substituting in the value of $d_{top}$ from \hyperref[d_top]{Equation \ref*{d_top}}.
		We find that this constraint simply specifies that $r_c > D_{pipe}$ and, since we have assumed urban pipe have a bend radius of $r_c =  1.5D_{pipe} $ \textsuperscript{\cite{roh2005differential}}, this constraint should never be violated, as it required pipes which bend much more sharply than we will encounter.
		\\
		\hyperref[thetaCond2]{Condition \ref*{thetaCond2}} can also be simplified by substituting in \hyperref[d_left]{Equations \ref*{d_left} \& \ref*{d_right}}. 
		Thus we find that the failure criteria $d_{left} + d_{right} = 2 d_{top}$ occurs when $\sin \left( \beta \right) = 2$, which means that this constraint can never occur.
		\\
		Finally, \hyperref[alphaEq]{Equation \ref*{alphaEq}} is derived from a constraint that specified that the difference between $alpha$ and the right hand side is a multiple of $2 \pi$ (in radians).
		Since we know the value of $\alpha$ is between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, which are both less than $2 \pi$, this constraint sets the value of $\alpha - (\ref*{alphaEq}) = 0$, allowing us to calculate $\alpha$ directly as in \hyperref[alphaEq]{Equation \ref*{alphaEq}}.
		
		\subsection{Actuation Control}
		
		The robot needs to be able to accurately control the length of its legs in order to maintain the correct normal force for operation.
		We know the required linear actuator force for climbing vertically from \hyperref[reqMaxNorm]{Equation \ref*{reqMaxNorm}}, which we can modify to find that:
	
		\begin{align}
			F &= \frac{W \sin \left( \psi \right) \cos \left( \phi \right)}{6 \mu_{t,p} \tan \left( \theta \right)}
		\end{align}
	
		where $\psi$ is the inclination of pipe worked out from \hyperref[angleEq]{Equation \ref*{angleEq}}.
		\\
		Thus, if we know the weight of the robot, and we can estimate the pipe inclination $\psi$, as well as measuring the leg and foot angles $ \theta \&  \phi$, we can estimate the required actuator force.
		This means that the robot can set a target actuator force at all times in order to ensure that it able to traverse the pipe.
		\\
		While we initially considered having sensors on the robot to work out the pipe diameter, a much simpler solution was to use the linear actuators themselves. 
		Since we know the required normal force, we can extend the actuators, updating our value of theta until we reach that force, or close to it, using a $H_{\infty}$ controller.
		Thus, the force can be controlled to the point where the target value is reached, and the pipe diameter can be estimated by finding the base angle $\theta$.
	
		\begin{align}
			\cos \left( \theta \right) &= \cos \left( \theta_{min} \right) + \frac{E}{L}
			\intertext{where E is the extension of a single actuator. \newline We can then find that}
			D_{pipe} &= D_r + \frac{3 L}{2} \sin \left( \cos ^{-1} \left( \theta \right) \right)
			\\
			&= D_r + \frac{3 L}{2} \sin \left( \cos ^{-1} \left( \cos \left( \theta_{min} \right) + \frac{E}{L} \right) \right)
		\end{align}
	
		\hyperref[legDiagram]{Figure \ref*{legDiagram}} is reproduced as \hyperref[legDiagramRep]{Figure \ref*{legDiagramRep}} for reference of variables used.

			\label{legDiagramRep}			
		\end{figure}
	
		 $H_{\infty}$ control was chosen as the system dynamics can be well modelled for the extension of the leg, and fast performance is required.
		 This is because too little normal force is possible catastrophic, if the robot is travelling up a steeply inclined pipe, and too much normal force for too long could damage critical components.
		 While the system is non-linear, most of the variables simply contribute as fixed values, with the system only being non-linear in $\theta$.
		 However, in the region $20^\circ - 60^\circ, \sin \left( \theta \right)$ is relatively linear, so a linear control method was chosen.
